# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

- My motivation for this project was to create a functional study guide that is easy to ready and can hold basic info of what I am learning.
- I built this project because I wanted to break down and show a systimatic list of my learnings.
- I solved the amount of info I would have forgotten if it were not implented and writen down in this study guide.
- I learned how to use Git/Github, The basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I Also learned the process of debugging.
